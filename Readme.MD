# KCMenu
This is a replacement for my old kc_menu which was originally using menuV, this is much easier to use for me.

So far I have some player options, vehicle options and music options but not much is here.

There is also marker testing for this for teleporting between two points on the map.

I will probably migrate away from menuV and switch to ox_lib, it is newer and more supported.
Eventually, I may remove kc_menu from the main fivem scripts repo and rename this project to kc_menu.

Anyone is welcome to use this code, please give credit if you do.
